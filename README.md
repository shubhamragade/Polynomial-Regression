# Polynomial Regression on Advertising Dataset

This project explores the relationship between **Sales** and advertising expenditures in different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) using **Polynomial Regression**. The goal is to predict `Sales` based on ad spending and improve the model's performance by incorporating polynomial features.

## Features of the Project
- Analyzes the impact of advertising on sales using regression.
- Uses **Polynomial Regression** to capture non-linear relationships.
- Built using **Python** and **scikit-learn** for efficient model implementation.
- Includes data preprocessing, feature transformation, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset (`advertising.csv`) contains the following columns:
- **TV**: Advertising budget for TV in thousands of dollars.
- **Radio**: Advertising budget for Radio in thousands of dollars.
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget for Newspaper in thousands of dollars.
- **Sales**: Generated sales (in thousands of units).
